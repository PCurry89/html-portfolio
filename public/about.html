<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have always loved computers, ever since I was a teenager. I hate that I waited so long to finally get into it, but Im very
  glad I did. It was actually between computers and healthcare. I did go and get my Medical Assistant license and enjoyed that for 
  almost 5 years. The pandemic kind of tired me out from it, so I took a break. I then went and got my CDL Class A license and
  enjooyed driving around the United States for a year. Now Im ready to jump into the tech world!
